# DevConnector
A Udemy Course Web App in React and Nodejs

<Strong>Goals</Strong>

The following are experiences I learned from the project:

		Gained experience coding in React and Nodejs
		Used command-line arguments. 
		Gained experience using React/Redux libraries
		Worked with a no-relational db in MongoDB
		Deployed web application to Heroku
    
<Strong>Description</Strong>

I created a web application connecting web developers with one another. The application allows web developers to view other developer profiles, register and create individual accounts, and create and post comments.

Much thanks go to Brad Traversy for the tutorial, which I purchased on Udemy.

Tech: React, Nodejs, Express, Mongoose, MongoDB, Heroku
